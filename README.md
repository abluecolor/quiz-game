# quiz-game

A simple Python project, "quiz-game," that allows users to play a console-based quiz. The game presents easy coding questions and includes a scoring system to track the player's performance.

## lessons learned

Through the development of this project, I focused on reviewing and reinforcing fundamental Python concepts, such as:

- Python syntax and coding conventions
- Conditional statements
- Defining functions for code organization
- Variable declaration and scoping
- Iterative loops and recursive functions
